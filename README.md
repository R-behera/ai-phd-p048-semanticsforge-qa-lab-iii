# Adaptive RedTeam AI Lab: NLP for III-Aligned Research

A professor-outreach research proposal aligned with **Hal Daume III** at **University of Maryland**.

## For Professor Outreach

This repo is intended to support an honest outreach email. It contains a concrete proposal for what value you can add, but it does **not** yet contain completed experiments or results.

Start here:

- `outreach/value_add_packet.md` - professor-specific contribution plan.
- `outreach/email_draft.md` - short mail draft you can personalize before sending.
- `docs/one_page_project_plan.md` - one-page project summary.
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - clear statement of what exists and what does not exist yet.

## Research Question

How can a focused, reproducible artifact around **NLP** create useful research infrastructure for a lab working on **NLP, ML, fairness, structured prediction**?

## Advisor Fit

- **Professor:** Hal Daume III
- **University:** University of Maryland
- **Program:** Computer Science
- **CSV research area:** NLP, ML, fairness, structured prediction
- **Representative paper:** Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation; 2007; ACL
- **Scholar link:** https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Frustratingly+Easy+Domain+Adaptation

## Proposed Research-Grade Deliverable

Build **an adaptive red-team and repair harness for robustness, safety, privacy, or fairness failures** with:

- A red-team prompt/data suite with severity labels.
- Attack or stress-test success metrics.
- Before/after repair table with regression checks.
- A failure taxonomy suitable for a short workshop-style report.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest
```

## Repository Map

- `outreach/value_add_packet.md` - value-add plan for this professor.
- `outreach/email_draft.md` - email draft; personalize before sending.
- `docs/research_brief.md` - project hypothesis, novelty, methods, and evaluation plan.
- `docs/one_page_project_plan.md` - one-page project summary.
- `docs/experiment_plan.md` - baseline, ablation, and reporting protocol.
- `configs/baseline.yaml` - first experiment configuration placeholder.
- `reproducibility/commands.md` - exact commands and environment notes.
- `data/source_programs.csv` - original CSV for traceability.

## Status

Proposal scaffold only. Before external use, verify the professor's current lab page and make a selected repo public or shareable.
